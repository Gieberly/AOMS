        <p><b>Certificate of Attendance or any similar document that your last school attended may issue is acceptable. Provided that the document will show the duration of your residency/stay in that school.</b></p>
        <p>The required document is for OUR to check if your academic record was indeed issued by your LAST School attended. This is to avoid problems later in requesting permanent records to be issued to Benguet State University.</p>

        <p>Yes, we are accepting applications for admission from transferees. Please refer to the documents required for transferees.</p>
        <p>NOTE: The year level of admitted transferees will depend on the number of units that will be carried/credited based on the curriculum. For example: A second year student transferring to BSU may be evaluated as a first year student because he/she only finished 15% of the courses prescribed in the curriculum.</p>

        <p>Authorized representatives may process the application for admission for and in behalf of the applicant. Together with the application documents, your representative must submit the original hard copy of the duly signed Authorization Letter, 1 photocopy of 1 valid ID of the applicant and 1 photocopy of 1 valid ID of the representative. If a representative from schools will process for their students or for any group filing/processing of application for admission, the same requirements are needed.</p>
